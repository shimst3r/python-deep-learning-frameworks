# [Python Deep Learning Frameworks](https://www.github.com/shimst3r/python-deep-learning-frameworks)

Python Deep Learning Frameworks is a list of deep learning frameworks that are implemented in Python and hosted on GitHub. It is intended as an entry point for people new to deep learning in Python. The project is inspired by @mingrammer's [Top Python Web Frameworks](https://github.com/mingrammer/python-web-framework-stars).

## Analytics

Basic analytics of The List are available in [this notebook](./notebooks/development_over_time.ipynb).
